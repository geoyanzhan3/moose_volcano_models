# Volcanic Deformation Modeling Using the MOOSE FEM Code

[MOOSE](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/index.html), the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment, is an open-source, parallel finite element framework.

Volcanic deformation modeling is widely used to indicate volcanic unrest. Numerical simulation is essential for solving problems with:
- Irregular geometry (e.g., topography or irregular magma reservoirs),
- Nonlinear loading,
- Nonlinear material properties, and
- Multiphysics coupling.

To facilitate the community's access to open-source finite element code for volcanic deformation modeling, I developed a series of models using MOOSE.
